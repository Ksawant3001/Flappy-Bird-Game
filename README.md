The Flappy Bird game is a simple side-scrolling game implemented in JavaScript by using the HTML5 and CSS. 
In this game, a small bird continuously moves to the right, and the player must navigate it through a series of vertically arranged pipes with gaps. The bird falls due to gravity, and the player must click or press a key (usually the spacebar) to make the bird  fly. 
The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible to achieve a high score. 
As this game is still under progress, it does not save the last high score and still have some minor update.
